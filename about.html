        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>
          I started my bookkeeping journey over seven years ago, working with a variety of businesses that all shared one thing in common: they wanted to understand their numbers but didn’t have the time or systems to make sense of them. I saw the relief that clear, reliable bookkeeping could bring—and I wanted to create that for more small business owners.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-12">
          Today, I serve entrepreneurs and growing businesses across the U.S., helping them clean up their books, manage payroll, and stay tax-ready all year long. My mission is simple: make your financial life easier and empower you with clarity so you can focus on what matters most—your business and your family.

      <h2 class="light-text">Beyond the Numbers</h2>
      <p class="light-muted">
        When I’m not reconciling accounts or preparing reports, you’ll find me spending time with my husband and kids, enjoying Oregon’s beautiful coast, or working on creative home projects. I believe balance and clarity go hand in hand and that’s what I strive to bring to every client relationship.

        <h2>Why I Love What I Do</h2>
        <p class="muted">
          Numbers tell a story—your story. They show where you’ve been and where you’re headed. I love taking what can feel overwhelming and turning it into something empowering. Whether it’s catching up messy books or building ongoing systems, I take pride in helping my clients feel in control and confident.
